Redox is the single API for connecting to products, providers, and payers. It unlocks data that is typically facilitated by event-driven interfaces in the specific domain language (HL7v2, CDA, X12) by offering a normalized JSON output that non-integration experts can access. This enables builders of healthcare integrations to move more quickly. It's an industry leader in its offering and its mission is to unite patients and providers by making healthcare data more accessible, while maintaining a high standard for security and integrity.
