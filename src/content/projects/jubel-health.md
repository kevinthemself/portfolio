Jubel Health is a product aimed at solving one of the most pressing issues that patients encounter when undergoing their personal fertility journey: access to information. Whether it's asking if fertility treatment is right for the user, or a specific question about their specific fertility treatment, Jubel Health answers users' questions with personalized, medically-vetted information 24/7.

Jubel Health also allows users to access the greater fertility health community; a community of peers and experts to support each other in the treatment of fertility issues. The application enables discussion by allowing users to book fireside chats to learn from fertility experts directly.
