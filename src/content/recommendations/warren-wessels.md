Kevin is a quick-learning, detail-oriented engineer who tackles work head-on. In my time working with them, they showed not only that they could dig into challenging problems and find strong solutions, but also that they were undaunted by things that were brand new to them. I was impressed by their willingness to dive into the unknown, learn, test theories, change approach, measure results, and ultimately turn that unknown into a known.

Across the stack, Kevin was a friendly, capable, and productive engineer. I'm happy to recommend Kevin to any team looking for an engineer with a growth-mindset.
