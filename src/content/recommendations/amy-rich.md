Kev is an excellent collaborator who cares deeply about helping the team focus and find a good path forward, making sound architectural decisions, and ensuring that consistent progress is made on technical debt. He's always willing to learn new skills and pair with others, to lean and teach, to help the team as a whole be successful. While at Redox, they worked across the front and back end to help deliver a key customer-requested feature and to help us establish a new, international presence. Any company would be lucky to have Kev work for them!
