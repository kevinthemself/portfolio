Kevin was the teacher's assistant for my cohort at UCSD's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. He demonstrated great knowledge and expertise in answering questions at another level compared to the other TA's. His tenacity and patience for solving complex programming problems truly shows. I am fully confident that any top software engineering company will find him to be a great asset to their team.
